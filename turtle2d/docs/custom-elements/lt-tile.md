# &lt;lt-tile&gt;

The `<lt-tile>` element, or Tile, is custom element for static game objects. Tile elements can be solid, and can have background images that repeat along the X axis, Y axis, or both. Tile elements are often used for buildings, backgrounds, or other large non-interactive sections of the game.
